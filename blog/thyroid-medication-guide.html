        <h1>Thyroid Medication Guide: Levothyroxine, Liothyronine, and More</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">Updated February 9, 2026 &middot; 10 min read &middot; Reviewed by thrive.md Clinical Advisory Team</div>

        <p>Thyroid medications are among the most prescribed drugs in the world. Levothyroxine alone consistently ranks in the top five most dispensed medications in the United States, with over 100 million prescriptions filled annually. Despite how common these drugs are, questions about dosing, timing, brand differences, and alternatives come up constantly. This guide covers what you should know.</p>

        <h2>Medications for Hypothyroidism</h2>

        <h3>Levothyroxine (Synthetic T4)</h3>
        <p>Levothyroxine is the standard treatment for hypothyroidism and has been for decades. It is a synthetic form of T4, identical in structure to the hormone the thyroid produces naturally. The body converts T4 to the more active T3 in peripheral tissues as needed, which is why T4 replacement alone is sufficient for most patients.</p>

        <p>Brand names include Synthroid, Levoxyl, Unithroid, and Tirosint. There are also numerous generic formulations. While all contain levothyroxine sodium, there are small differences in inactive ingredients (fillers, dyes, binders) that can affect absorption in some individuals. The ATA recommends that patients stay on the same formulation when possible, rather than switching between brands or between brand and generic, to maintain consistent thyroid levels.</p>

        <p>Levothyroxine is available in a wide range of doses, from 25 mcg to 300 mcg, allowing precise titration. The typical full replacement dose is approximately 1.6 mcg per kilogram of body weight per day, though many patients require more or less depending on their residual thyroid function, age, and other factors.</p>

        <h3>How to Take Levothyroxine</h3>
        <p>Absorption is the critical issue with levothyroxine. The drug is absorbed in the small intestine, and its bioavailability is significantly affected by stomach contents. Standard guidance includes:</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Take it on an empty stomach, ideally 30 to 60 minutes before breakfast</li>
            <li>Use water only — coffee, even black coffee, reduces absorption by roughly 30% in some studies</li>
            <li>Separate from calcium supplements, iron supplements, and antacids by at least four hours</li>
            <li>Proton pump inhibitors (PPIs) and certain other medications can also impair absorption</li>
            <li>Consistency matters more than perfection — taking it the same way each day is key</li>
        </ul>

        <p>For patients who cannot reliably take the medication 30-60 minutes before food, bedtime dosing (at least three hours after the last meal) is a reasonable alternative. Some studies have found comparable or even slightly better absorption with bedtime dosing.</p>

        <p>Tirosint, a gel capsule and liquid formulation of levothyroxine, was specifically designed for patients with absorption issues. It contains no dyes, gluten, lactose, or other common fillers and may be better absorbed in patients taking PPIs or those with gastrointestinal conditions.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p>If you miss a dose, take it as soon as you remember. If it is close to the next day's dose, you can safely take both doses together. Levothyroxine has a long half-life (about seven days), so a single missed dose does not cause an immediate problem. However, regularly missing doses will lead to fluctuating thyroid levels.</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Liothyronine (Synthetic T3)</h3>
        <p>Liothyronine (Cytomel) is a synthetic form of T3, the more biologically active thyroid hormone. It works faster than levothyroxine — effects begin within hours rather than weeks — but it also has a much shorter half-life (about one day versus seven days for T4). This means blood levels fluctuate more throughout the day.</p>

        <p>Liothyronine is not recommended as sole therapy for hypothyroidism. It is sometimes used in combination with levothyroxine for patients who continue to feel poorly despite adequate T4 levels. The ATA's 2014 guidelines stopped short of recommending routine combination therapy but acknowledged that it may be considered on an individual basis when patients remain symptomatic.</p>

        <h3>Desiccated Thyroid Extract</h3>
        <p>Desiccated thyroid extract (DTE) — sold as Armour Thyroid, NP Thyroid, and Nature-Throid — is derived from pig thyroid glands. It contains both T4 and T3 in a roughly 4:1 ratio. Some patients report feeling better on DTE than on levothyroxine alone, though controlled trials have not consistently demonstrated a superiority of DTE over levothyroxine.</p>

        <p>The T4:T3 ratio in DTE is not identical to human physiological ratios, and the T3 component produces sharper peaks and troughs in blood levels compared to the body's own steady conversion of T4 to T3. Despite these pharmacological drawbacks, patient preference is a legitimate factor in treatment decisions, and some endocrinologists will prescribe DTE when patients prefer it and respond well to it.</p>

        <h2>Medications for Hyperthyroidism</h2>

        <h3>Methimazole</h3>
        <p>Methimazole (Tapazole) is the first-line antithyroid drug in the United States for most patients. It works by inhibiting the enzyme thyroid peroxidase, blocking the incorporation of iodine into thyroid hormone. Effects become apparent within one to three weeks, with full effect at four to eight weeks.</p>

        <p>The most serious but rare side effect is agranulocytosis — a dangerous drop in white blood cells — which occurs in roughly 0.2-0.5% of patients. Patients are advised to seek immediate medical attention if they develop a fever or sore throat while on the medication. Liver toxicity is also possible but uncommon. More common side effects include rash, joint pain, and gastrointestinal upset.</p>

        <h3>Propylthiouracil (PTU)</h3>
        <p>PTU works through a similar mechanism to methimazole but also blocks the conversion of T4 to T3 in peripheral tissues. It carries a higher risk of severe liver failure compared to methimazole and is generally reserved for specific situations: the first trimester of pregnancy (when methimazole has a small teratogenic risk), thyroid storm, and patients who have had adverse reactions to methimazole.</p>

        <h2>Dose Adjustments and Monitoring</h2>
        <p>For hypothyroidism treatment, TSH is the primary monitoring tool. After starting levothyroxine or changing the dose, TSH should be rechecked in six to eight weeks. Adjustments are typically made in increments of 12.5 to 25 mcg. Once stable, annual TSH monitoring is usually sufficient.</p>

        <p>Certain life events require dose reassessment:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Pregnancy — requirements increase by 25-50% in most women, often within the first trimester. TSH should be checked as soon as pregnancy is confirmed.</li>
            <li>Significant weight change — dose may need adjustment with substantial gain or loss</li>
            <li>Starting or stopping estrogen therapy — estrogen increases thyroid-binding globulin, which can alter free hormone levels</li>
            <li>Aging — older adults often need lower doses as metabolism slows</li>
            <li>New medications that affect absorption — starting a PPI, calcium, or iron supplement</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Common Questions About Thyroid Medication</h2>

        <h3>Can I switch between brands?</h3>
        <p>You can, but it may require TSH monitoring after the switch. Different formulations have slightly different bioavailabilities. If your pharmacy substitutes a different generic, pay attention to how you feel and consider checking your TSH in six to eight weeks.</p>

        <h3>Is generic levothyroxine as good as brand?</h3>
        <p>For most patients, yes. FDA-approved generics must meet bioequivalence standards. However, the allowable variation between formulations means that switching between different generics could produce meaningful fluctuations for some patients. If you are well-controlled on a specific formulation, it is reasonable to request that your pharmacy dispense the same one consistently.</p>

        <h3>Will I be on medication forever?</h3>
        <p>For hypothyroidism caused by Hashimoto's, thyroid surgery, or radioactive iodine treatment, the answer is almost always yes. The underlying conditions are permanent. For hyperthyroidism treated with antithyroid drugs, some patients achieve lasting remission and can eventually stop medication, though relapse rates are significant.</p>
