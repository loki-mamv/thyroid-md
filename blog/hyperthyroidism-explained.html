        <h1>Hyperthyroidism Explained: Causes, Symptoms, and Treatment Options</h1>
        <div class="article-meta">Updated February 9, 2026 &middot; 9 min read &middot; Reviewed by thrive.md Clinical Advisory Team</div>

        <p>Hyperthyroidism is a condition in which the thyroid gland produces more hormone than the body needs. The excess speeds up metabolism, and while that might sound appealing in the abstract, the reality is unpleasant and potentially dangerous. The heart races. Weight drops without trying. Sleep becomes difficult. Left untreated, hyperthyroidism can lead to serious cardiac complications including atrial fibrillation and heart failure.</p>

        <p>About 1.2% of Americans have hyperthyroidism, according to NIDDK data. It is roughly five to ten times more common in women than men, with peak onset between ages 20 and 50.</p>

        <h2>How the Thyroid Becomes Overactive</h2>

        <h3>Graves' Disease</h3>
        <p>Graves' disease causes roughly 60-80% of hyperthyroidism cases in the United States. It is an autoimmune disorder in which the immune system produces antibodies called thyroid-stimulating immunoglobulins (TSI) that mimic TSH and continuously stimulate the thyroid to produce hormone. The gland enlarges and overproduces T3 and T4 without the normal feedback controls.</p>

        <p>Graves' disease has a strong genetic component. If a first-degree relative has the condition, your risk increases substantially. Smoking is a well-established risk factor, particularly for the eye complications known as Graves' ophthalmopathy. Stress and infections may also trigger the onset in genetically susceptible individuals.</p>

        <h3>Toxic Nodular Goiter</h3>
        <p>In toxic multinodular goiter and toxic adenoma, one or more thyroid nodules begin producing hormone independently of TSH regulation. This is more common in older adults and in populations with a history of iodine deficiency. Unlike Graves' disease, the excess hormone production comes from autonomous nodules rather than antibody stimulation.</p>

        <h3>Thyroiditis</h3>
        <p>Inflammation of the thyroid can cause stored hormone to leak into the bloodstream, producing a temporary phase of hyperthyroidism. Subacute thyroiditis (often following a viral infection) and postpartum thyroiditis (occurring in the first year after delivery) are the most common forms. The hyperthyroid phase typically lasts several weeks before resolving on its own or transitioning to a hypothyroid phase.</p>

        <h3>Excess Iodine and Medications</h3>
        <p>Amiodarone, a medication used for heart rhythm disorders, contains large amounts of iodine and can trigger hyperthyroidism. Excess iodine from contrast dyes or supplements can also cause overproduction in susceptible individuals, particularly those with pre-existing nodular disease.</p>

        <h2>Recognizing the Symptoms</h2>
        <p>Hyperthyroidism accelerates the body's processes, and the symptoms reflect that acceleration across multiple organ systems.</p>

        <ul>
            <li>Rapid or irregular heartbeat (palpitations), sometimes exceeding 100 beats per minute at rest</li>
            <li>Unintentional weight loss despite normal or increased appetite</li>
            <li>Heat intolerance and excessive sweating</li>
            <li>Tremor in the hands and fingers</li>
            <li>Anxiety, irritability, and difficulty sleeping</li>
            <li>Frequent bowel movements or diarrhea</li>
            <li>Muscle weakness, particularly in the upper arms and thighs</li>
            <li>Thinning skin and fine, brittle hair</li>
            <li>Menstrual irregularities — lighter or less frequent periods</li>
            <li>Enlarged thyroid gland (goiter)</li>
        </ul>

        <p>In Graves' disease specifically, some patients develop eye symptoms: bulging eyes (exophthalmos), eye irritation, double vision, or light sensitivity. This occurs because the same antibodies that attack the thyroid also target tissues behind the eyes.</p>

        <div class="callout">
            <p>Older adults sometimes present with fewer typical symptoms. They may have only unexplained weight loss, atrial fibrillation, or fatigue — a presentation sometimes called apathetic hyperthyroidism. This makes diagnosis more challenging in elderly patients.</p>
        </div>

        <h2>Diagnosis</h2>
        <p>A suppressed (low) TSH is the hallmark finding. When the thyroid pumps out excess hormone, the pituitary stops producing TSH in an attempt to slow things down. Free T4 and free T3 levels are then measured to confirm the diagnosis and assess severity.</p>

        <p>To determine the cause, physicians may order TSI or TSH receptor antibody (TRAb) tests for Graves' disease, or a radioactive iodine uptake scan to differentiate between Graves' disease (high uptake), toxic nodules (focal uptake), and thyroiditis (low uptake). The distinction matters because treatment differs significantly depending on the underlying cause.</p>

        <h2>Treatment Options</h2>

        <h3>Antithyroid Medications</h3>
        <p>Methimazole is the preferred antithyroid drug in the United States. It blocks the thyroid's ability to produce new hormone. Most patients notice improvement within two to four weeks, with full effect at six to twelve weeks. Propylthiouracil (PTU) is an alternative, generally reserved for the first trimester of pregnancy (when methimazole carries a small risk of birth defects) or for patients who cannot tolerate methimazole.</p>

        <p>For Graves' disease, a typical treatment course lasts 12 to 18 months. About 30-50% of patients achieve lasting remission after a course of antithyroid medication. The rest relapse and usually proceed to definitive treatment with radioactive iodine or surgery.</p>

        <h3>Radioactive Iodine Therapy</h3>
        <p>Radioactive iodine (RAI) is the most common definitive treatment for Graves' disease in the United States. Taken as a single oral dose, it is absorbed by the thyroid and gradually destroys overactive tissue over several weeks to months. The treatment is effective in roughly 80-90% of cases with a single dose.</p>

        <p>The primary consequence is hypothyroidism, which develops in most patients within six to twelve months. This is expected and managed with levothyroxine replacement — trading an unpredictable, harder-to-control condition for one that is straightforward to treat. RAI is not used during pregnancy or breastfeeding.</p>

        <h3>Surgery</h3>
        <p>Total or near-total thyroidectomy is an option when RAI is contraindicated, when a large goiter causes compressive symptoms, or when the patient prefers a surgical approach. It provides immediate resolution but carries risks including damage to the parathyroid glands (affecting calcium regulation) and injury to the recurrent laryngeal nerve (affecting the voice). These complications are uncommon in the hands of experienced surgeons.</p>

        <h3>Beta-Blockers</h3>
        <p>Beta-blockers like propranolol do not treat the thyroid itself but quickly relieve symptoms such as rapid heart rate, tremor, and anxiety. They are often prescribed as a bridge while waiting for antithyroid medications or RAI to take full effect.</p>

        <h2>Long-Term Outlook</h2>
        <p>With appropriate treatment, most people with hyperthyroidism do very well. The choice between antithyroid medication, radioactive iodine, and surgery depends on the cause, severity, patient age, and personal preference. Each approach has trade-offs, and the decision should be made in partnership with an endocrinologist who can explain the risks and benefits specific to your situation.</p>

        <p>Regardless of which treatment path is chosen, ongoing monitoring is essential. Thyroid function should be checked regularly — initially every few weeks, then every few months, and eventually annually once stable. Patients who undergo RAI or surgery will need lifelong thyroid hormone replacement and monitoring.</p>
