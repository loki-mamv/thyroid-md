            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Do children outgrow asthma?</h2>
                <p>About 50% of children with asthma experience improvement or remission by adolescence, but asthma can return in adulthood. Factors like early onset, severity, allergies, and family history influence whether symptoms persist. Continued monitoring is important even during remission periods.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Is asthma genetic?</h2>
                <p>Asthma has a genetic component — having a parent with asthma increases your risk. However, environmental factors (allergen exposure, respiratory infections, air pollution) also play significant roles. You can develop asthma without family history, and not everyone with a family history develops it.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>Can weather affect asthma?</h2>
                <p>Yes. Cold, dry air can trigger airway constriction. High humidity promotes mold and dust mites. Thunderstorms can cause "thunderstorm asthma" by breaking pollen into smaller particles. Monitor air quality and adjust outdoor activities during extreme weather conditions.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="faq-item">
                <h2>What should I do during an asthma attack?</h2>
                <p>Use your rescue inhaler immediately (2-4 puffs). Sit upright, stay calm, and breathe slowly. If symptoms don't improve within 15-20 minutes, use your inhaler again and call 911. Severe attacks require emergency care — don't delay seeking help.</p>
